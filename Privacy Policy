Privacy Policy for LEIS App
Last Updated: 18/03/2025

Welcome to LEIS. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).
By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.

1. Information We Collect
We collect certain types of information to provide and improve our services. This includes:
a. Camera Permissions
•	The App uses the camera only for scanning QR codes to retrieve hardware serial numbers.
•	We do not store, share, or use your camera data for any other purpose.
b. Bluetooth Permissions
•	The App requires Bluetooth to read and write data with LEIS hardware using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
•	Bluetooth is used to communicate with external devices, but we do not store or share Bluetooth data with third parties.
c. Location Permissions
•	The App requests access to location services because Android requires location access to scan and connect to Bluetooth devices.
•	We do not track your real-time location, and this permission is used solely for Bluetooth functionality.
d. Internet Access
•	The App requires an internet connection for certain features, such as accessing remote services.

2. How We Use Your Information
The information collected is used solely to:
•	Enable QR scanning for hardware identification.
•	Facilitate Bluetooth connections and communication with LEIS devices.
•	Comply with Android requirements for Bluetooth device discovery.
•	Improve app functionality and user experience.
We do not share your data with third parties, except as required by law.

3. Data Security
We take reasonable steps to protect your data against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of electronic transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

4. Third-Party Services
The App may use third-party services, such as Google Play Services, which have their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their policies for more information.

5. Your Choices and Rights
•	You can manage app permissions from your device settings.
•	If you do not grant necessary permissions, certain app features may not function properly.

6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App, and your continued use after updates indicates acceptance.
